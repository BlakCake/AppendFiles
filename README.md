# AppendFiles
A simple and easy tool to append multiple text/.csv files

This is one of the tools I made while working at Dell. Helped a lot when we had to combine hundreds or even thousands of csv files.

All you have to do is select the folder where the files are, select an output folder and press Append

You can also tick the "Place a line every file" checkbox if  some or all of your files end without a return or a new line. This usually fixes any errors.
